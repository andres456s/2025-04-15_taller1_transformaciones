# Welcome to another space   
Create a new space with **ready-made experiences** or by **importing your own custom data**. This guide provides a quick overview of how to explore the Experience Gallery and manage your imports and exports.   
### Discover Ready-Made Experiences    
The Vault panel on the left takes you to the **Gallery** – a curated collection of content crafted by our community. With a few clicks, you can install use cases to jumpstart your journey. To see more of these, stop by the [ANY Experience Gallery](https://gallery.any.coop/) in your browser, at any time.   
### Bring Your Own Content   
Already have notes, ideas, or data you’d like to include? Head to your space settings and look for Import/Export. You can import Markdown, CSV files, and more to migrate from Notion, Obsidian, Evernote, and [other platforms](https://doc.anytype.io/anytype-docs/basics/import-export). Short on time? Just type "Import" or "Export" in the search bar to get there faster.   
From here on, it’s all about making this space uniquely yours. Feel free to explore, experiment, and watch your own digital space evolve.
